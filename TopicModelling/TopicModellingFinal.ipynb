    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we present an approach to Topic Modelling using a basic linear algebra concept called **Singular Value Decomposition** with a little demonstration. We took inspiration from the Numeric Linear Algebra course which was taught by Rachel Thomas at the University of San Francisco in 2017 and is available online: https://github.com/fastai/numerical-linear-algebra/tree/master/nbs . This notebook aims to give more insight into the topic and is written in order to allow an interactive familiarization with the concept.\n",

    "SVD is a very useful tool to do topic modelling which implicitly gives you a lot of information. Depending on the use-case, different preprocessing should be done. At all times it should be kept in mind that this is an unsupervised learning model and you therefore have to be more flexible in interpreting the results as compared to supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other Matrix decompositions like Nonnegative Matrix Decompisition which can also be used for topic modelling but the fields of application are really only limited by your imagination, as SVD for instance can be used for background removal in videos and data compression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix Decomposition in general is a very basic yet powerfull concept, that can be implemented using open source toolkits and libraries and have direct real life use cases without needing any sophisticated deep learning models. These kind of mathematical (Linear Algebra) concepts are the basic fundamentals of AI."
